This repositories contais all the work I developed during the time I worked for [my Google Summer of Code 2025 project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/projects/YR0AVIjH). 
This project aims to develop a user-friendly, browser-based interface for existing oceanographic [data quality control](https://github.com/ocefpaf/ioos_qc_webapp) and [compliance checker tools](https://github.com/ioos/compliance-checker-web/tree/master). Its primary goal is to provide users with an interactive platform to validate and analyze their datasets more efficiently.

The application includes two web interfaces that enable users to upload their datasets, select the appropriate checks, and customize parameters as needed. In return, the tool generates data visualizations that present the results of quality control and compliance assessments. Users can also download the processed datasets for further use.

By offering a convenient and accessible solution, this project reduces the need for coding expertise. This could significantly enhances the usability of existing tools by bringing them to a flexible, browser-based environment, making advanced quality control more accessible to a broader range of users.

**Projects from the Bonding Period**

During the bonding period, prior to the official coding phase, I worked on smaller projects to familiarize myself with HTML page development, explore the necessary packages for my project, and gain hands-on experience with specific tools I would later use.

1. [Simple web app to load .cvs file from a given URL or from the local disk](https://mochiara.github.io/Chiara_GSoC25/csv_viewer_web/fileloading.html)
2. [Creating a simple web unit conversion tool using PyScript and pyudunits2](https://mochiara.github.io/Chiara_GSoC25/unit_conversion_webapp/unitconverter.html)
3. [IOOS qc webapp using pyodide](https://mochiara.github.io/Chiara_GSoC25/ioosqc_pyodide/ioos_qc_webpyodide.html)
